# Dr_Gato Where is my ATV?
The <span style="color:lime">ATV</span>. should appear on the Radar (The <span style="color:lime">Green</span> Dot.), alerting you to where it is on the map.

In the event you cannot see the ATV nor find it, you can reset it from the `Save Menu` by clicking the `Reset Slot` button and checking the `Vehicle` option.

# Dr_Gato Why do the researchers complain about empty drives?
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

The other researchers are a little strict and will judge you accordingly. Your drives aren't empty, they just don't contain data that can be read so easily.

If you want them to shut up, just upgrade your `Computer Power Processing Level`. Nobody likes unprocessed drives.

# Dr_Gato Will Multiplayer/Virtual Reality be Introduced?
Well, erm, we can't afford to have more than one researcher out on the field at once. Dunkeltaler is a... *unique*... forest.

Point is it isn't safe enough for Prof. Lea and Dr. Bao to send out more than one researcher anymore. We've had to evacuate the whole facility and can't afford another incident.

BUT- We have been working with Megacorp to develop new technology. Eventually, a virtual scan of the world will allow you to experience the intrigue of Dunkeltaler yourself. As long as you're willing to wait until late 202X, that is-

Basically, **don't expect to work with someone out there in Dunkeltaler**, but **you can expect to see an eventual recreation of it in "Virtual Reality"** (or whatever you kids call it...)

# Dr_Gato Are there Mods?
Yes, there are mods for the game. You can download them from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/voices-of-the-void/).

If you are interested in modding your game, also check out [Modding.Ariral.space](https://modding.ariral.space/).

# Dr_Gato Why is my Sun censored?
Well, say hello to your newest threat, the *Bad Sun*.

I recommend you stay inside. Unless you want your face melted off, that is...

Unknown phenomena cause this event on the 24th of the month, as well as very rarely out of season.

# Dr_Gato What's up with the mannequins?
They were left by a previous employee who went... missing...

Everyone was allowed to bring something to entertain themselves with. That employee was specifically interesting in tailoring, and such, they wanted mannequins to dress their clothes with. It was a great idea to entertain themselves but a horrible idea in the eyes of the other employees.

Well, atleast you won't feel alone. For better or for worse... Maybe just make sure you treat them well.

            fetch("./vault/THEYAREALIVE.html");
        }
    }
</script>

I wouldn't risk burning them either.

# Dr_Gato Why is this area of Dunkeltaler fenced off?
DO NOT LEAVE THE FENCED-OFF FOREST!!!

You realize that the fence isn't there to keep you in, right?

It's there to keep *it* out.

For your own sake, please do not investigate. I'm sure they don't want to have to find another idiot to go out there.

# Dr_Moon What is the Frame in the store for? (Mining Rig)
To start mining baocoin for passive income, you first have to purchase a `Frame` (under Machines, 200 points) and a `GPU Board` (under Misc, 200 points)

Craft a `Metal scrap` and hold it, then click on the `frame` to add a slot for GPUs. Hold the `GPU` and click the `frame` to slot it into the miner as well. 

Once your `frame` is plugged in and has a GPU slotted, it will start to generate points over time, as well as increasing in temperature. You can continue to add more GPUs, up to a maximum of `16 GPUs` although it is highly recommended to craft `Cooling Fans` to manage the increased temperature, lest you risk the entire operation blowing up in your face

`Cooling Fans` are crafted from `2 Accumulator Batteries` (under Misc, 150 points) , `4 Metal scrap` and `4 Electric Scrap`. `Cooling Fans` are installed by holding one and clicking the `frame`, up to a maximum of `6 Cooling Fans`.

A fully upgraded mining rig has a total cost of
`40 Metal Scrap`
`24 Electric Scrap`
`5,200 points` (`12 Accumulator Batteries`, `1 Frame`, `16 GPU boards`)

# Dr_Gato How do I clean up the base?
Are you silly? Has your mother never told you to clean your room?

Look around the base, there should be some trash bags left for you. If not, you can buy them from the store pretty cheap.

Hold the `Trash bags` in your hand and click on the piles of trash too big to collect. After you've put the trash into the bag, simply collect it like the smaller trash.

BONUS: If you want, feel free to purchase an `Item Box` from the store as well. You can put your trash bags full of trash in them and send them off with the drone. When I used to work with the others, *we paid our employees for cleaning up* if they could prove it. It makes it easier on us instead of hiring a cleanup crew.

# Dr_Gato How do I work the Industrial Printer?
Well, it is essentially a newer version of this "3-D Printing Technology" being developed.

You can basically create 3-D shapes of varying materials and paint them all sorts of colors. It's such an incredible piece of technology.

[If you're interested in using it, you can read more about it here](https://github.com/madrod228/voicesoftheprinter)

# Dr_Gato What do I do when my power goes out?
Start by checking outside of the base. Look for where the powerlines meet at the Main Generator. If one of the lines seems to be sparking, follow it to its designated `Transformer`. You'll need to restart the `Transformer` by pressing its button **TWICE**. Alternatively, you can go to a `Transformer` and reset it before it goes offline to prevent a potential blackout.

Don't worry about fueling them, they are so technologically advanced that they don't need standard fuel.
<div style="color:black;">I can hear it breathing. Is it alive? I swear I saw blood.</div>

If none of the Transformers appear to be causing issues, head back inside and check the Power Breakers. They're quite old and rusty, so I wouldn't put it past them to trip sometimes. Just flip them back on and you'll be on your way.

# Dr_Gato Why did my Transformer just go down after restarting it?
You didn't listen to my instructions.

Press the button on the Transformer **TWICE** to fully restart it. Make sure you don't hit the Transformer either, they are surprisingly fragile.

<div style="color:black;">So they are alive? Odd. How do they even work? Why don't we ever feed them? W h a t could be feeding them?</div>

# Dr_Gato Where do the explosions in the forest come from?
Surprisingly, the answer is mushrooms.

I know, I didn't believe it either when I first heard it. Nor when I first saw it.

White "Puffball" Mushrooms explode when fully mature in order to spread spores. Like, LITERALLY explode. This phenomenon seems tied to Dunkeltaler specifically too. Our lab-grown shrooms didn't yield any explosive results.

This property rarely carries over to things such as pinecones as well.
