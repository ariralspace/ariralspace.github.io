# How to Navigate this Site
This site runs on Megacorpâ„¢ Meadow-Server, which allows us Doctors to upload information in the form of messages, kind of like a "blog".

If only this damn server wasn't so finnicky and slow... it isn't a great interface for communicating, especially since Meadow-**Server** isn't capable of ***email communication***. Can you believe how stupid this is?

Anyways... If you've used a computer running Meadow in the past (surely you have if you've gained access to this site...) then you should notice that this Meadow-Server database of blog entries functions quite similar to the Meadow Email interface. Of course, only I can send new information to this database... for you, reading is all you are permitted to do.

# Who made this site?
The answer to that would be me, Dr. Gato!

...Well, kind of, since this is just the basic database included with Meadow-Server, but everything here is uploaded and curated by me! I've literally had to lock Dr. Bao out of here multiple times because he was more interested in obscuring than explaining.

This unfortunately made him very unhappy. He and Professor Lea decided that I could not communicate with anyone directly, and I was outcast from the rest of the researchers.

That is why I am here. I want to bring everyone together under *my* work. I hope that even as basic as this website is, that it will keep you all up to date with some useful tips for researching out there in Dunkeltaler forest!

\- Your Friend, Dr. Gato

(P.S. - Yes, I know Meadow-Server is quite slow, so don't complain about messages always loading so slowly.)
