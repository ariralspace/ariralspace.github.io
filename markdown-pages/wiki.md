# VotV Modding Wiki (Modding Wiki)

**This Wiki is a part of Ariral.Space**

This is the Modding Wiki that I (Gato) maintain. It isn't related to the game's secrets but rather adding to the game through modding.

# VotV Secrets Archive (Wiki)

In my opinion, the *best* website for VotV information. Feels like an old Y2K Fan Wiki, and I think it fits.

The information is mostly correct and anything you shouldn't be looking for has information for it there as well.

# EternityDev Fandom Wiki (Wiki)

Another good option, though sometimes outdated. It is managed by the community and has a section for VotV.

The most detailed information is usually found there, and I recommend anyone getting into the game who wants to look through a wiki to check this one out.

# Miraheze VotV Wiki (Wiki)

Personally, this is my least favorite Wiki due to how they choose to class things and the fact that it overall still feels unfinished after all this time.

They specifically missclass forbiddens and honestly half the entities are wrong, and got a lot of their details wrong and used vague information when constructing it. I wouldn't use it but if you would like to look at it or help improve it, go ahead.
