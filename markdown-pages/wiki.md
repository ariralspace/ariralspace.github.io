# Dr_Gato VotV Modding Wiki (Modding Wiki)

**This Wiki is a part of Ariral.Space**

This is the Modding Wiki that I (Gato) maintain. It isn't related to the game's secrets but rather adding to the game through modding.

# Dr_Gato VotV Secrets Archive (Wiki)

In my opinion, the *best* website for VotV information. Feels like an old Y2K Fan Wiki, and I think it fits.

The information is mostly correct and anything you shouldn't be looking for has information for it there as well.

# Dr_Gato EternityDev Fandom Wiki (Wiki)

Another good option, though sometimes outdated. It is managed by the community and has a section for VotV.

The most detailed information is usually found there, and I recommend anyone getting into the game who wants to look through a wiki to check this one out.
