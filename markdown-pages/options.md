# Dr_Gato Hold Up!

I'm still working on the Achievements and Options page! The more you explore the site, the more things you'll find and some things will reward you with an achievement.

In the meantime, try looking for the Two existing Achievements and for the Two secret `/vault/` pages. (https://ariral.space/vault/SECRET_PASSWORD)

Vault Pages can be found in more than one way. Try looking for hidden links/buttons.

**UPDATE 7/20/2024**

I am currently rewriting the Secret Vault pages to be run in a VotV emulated terminal.

Options menu and Achievements will follow soon after.

If you have nominations for the `Community` Tab then I will gladly put youtubers/twitch streamers or passion projects there.

Life has been pretty harsh recently and I've been trying to find the time to do what I love ever since.

*Holes* in my plans keep making it harder but I'll do this silly stuff for you guys soon <3
