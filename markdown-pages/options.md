# Dr_Gato Hold Up!

I'm still working on the Achievements and Options page! The more you explore the site, the more things you'll find and some things will reward you with an achievement.

In the meantime, try looking for the Two existing Achievements and for the Two secret `/vault/` pages. (https://ariral.space/vault/SECRET_PASSWORD)

Vault Pages can be found in more than one way. Try looking for hidden links/buttons.
